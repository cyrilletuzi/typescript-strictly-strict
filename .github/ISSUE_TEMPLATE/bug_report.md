Hi,

# Checks before posting an issue

- [ ] I have read all the extension's documentation README, especially "Known limitations"
  - [README](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/typescript-strictly-typed/blob/main/README.md)
- [ ] I have checked in already:
  - [opened issues](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/typescript-strictly-typed/issues)
  - [closed issues](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/typescript-strictly-typed/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
  - [questions answered](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/typescript-strictly-typed/discussions/categories/q-a) in the new "Discussions" tab
- [ ] My project meets the requirements indicated in README
- [ ] I understand I am writing to a *human being*, doing this open source project *unpaid*
- [ ] I will be involved in my own issue, by answering questions and informing if the issue is resolved

<!-- Otherwise the issue will be closed. -->

# Configuration

- Node version (`node -v`): 
- npm version (`npm -v`): 

# Description of the issue

<!-- Be precise, a vague description will not allow to find the problem.. -->

# How to reproduce the issue

<!-- Most common scenarios have already been tested, so without reproduction steps I will not be able to help. -->
